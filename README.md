# HashMix: Decentralized Cloud Hash Power Circulation Protocol


HashMix proposes a tokenization solution suitable for any hash power and implements a set of decentralized protocols with incentive mechanisms for general cloud hash power trading, lending, and swap to solve issues of hash power fraud, lack of liquidity and flexibility, allowing the free circulation of various forms of hash power beyond the geographical barriers. The main contributions of HashMix include the followings:


### Tokenization of hash power and corresponding on-chain proof

HashMix utilizes multi-signature, smart contract, and cross-chain technology to generate and submit proofs of specific hash power product to the blockchain, tokenize hash power to NFT tokens to eliminate the necessity of centralized endorsement so that hash power can be circulated freely while the ownership of the hash power NFT holders is ensured; the proofs and smart contract can solve the hash power fulfillment problem;

### Decentralized cloud hash power trading protocol

Based on the hash power NFT tokens, hash power can be traded in a decentralized manner. Traditional hash power for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and emerging Filecoin "cloud sealing capability" and "cloud storage power", all can be traded in a fully decentralized way without a trusted third party, while the security of hash power and trading funds is guaranteed.

### Cloud hash power lending protocol

Based on the hash power NFT, hash power can be used as collateral assets to realize a lending market, reducing friction in the process of lending transactions and the pressure on the borrower's cash flow, and making optimal application of funds and resources.


### Ownership confirmation of cloud hash power

Leveraging the characteristics of the non-fungible token (NFT), the cloud hash power is directly mapped to the physical mining hardware or storage resources in the real world, so itâ€™s easy to confirm ownership, eliminating legal risks.

### Cloud hash power swap protocol

Use hash power NFT to realize the swap of cloud hash power between different cryptocurrencies to increase flexibility.

### Incentive layer for cloud hash power circulation

Design and implement an incentive mechanism and credit system for the tokenization, transaction, and circulation of universal cloud hash power, to motivate the various players in the ecosystem and ensure the operation of the protocol.
